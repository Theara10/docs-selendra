Is there a minimum or maximum limit for investing in Selendra (SEL)? There is a minimum investment requirement of $10 US dollars (or the equivalent in crypto assets), while there is no maximum investment limit. 2. How can we invest in Selendra (SEL)? To invest in Selendra (SEL), you must first own Bitcoin (BTC), United States Dollar Tether (USDT), or some other negotiable crypto assets which you will be able to exchange for Selendra (SEL). To buy and hold BTC, USDT, SEL, or any crypto-asset, you will first need to have a crypto wallet application and then use that wallet application to deposit and hold your crypto assets. A crypto-asset wallet can be an offline wallet, such as the Trust Wallet, or a wallet incorporated into a crypto-asset exchange network. Some crypto-asset exchange networks we recommend are Binance, Kraken, and Poloniex. Once connected to your favourite crypto-asset exchange network, you can purchase BTC, USDT, or other popular crypto assets there. Instead of buying through a crypto exchange network, another method is to buy BTC or USDT from anyone you may know who is willing to sell, but you will still need a wallet in which to deposit your crypto asset purchases. An all-around good choice for a wallet is the Trust Wallet, the Metamask Wallet, or Selendra's own Bitriel Wallet. All three wallet application recommendations above are available through the Android and iPhone App Stores. In Cambodia, to buy crypto assets directly from individuals instead of through a crypto exchange network, visit http://t.me/cryptonomadex to connect up with a group of local professionals who buy and sell crypto assets locally. In other regions around the world, you should be able to find similar such groups as http://t.me/cryptonomadex that facilitate the direct and independent local buying and selling of crypto assets. Once you have your wallet and hold a balance of crypto assets, you may exchange your crypto assets for Selendra (SEL). 3. How do we hold, store and keep our crypto assets safe and secure? Selendra (SEL) crypto assets are now supported by three wallets. An all-around good choice for a Selendra (SEL) wallet is the Trust Wallet, the Metamask Wallet, or Selendra's own Bitriel Wallet. All three wallet applications above are available through the Android and iPhone App Stores. All crypto asset wallets require you, the wallet owner, and you alone to safely keep, store and remember a 12+ word phrase somewhere safe offline. These 12+ words in sequence act as your password key, so be careful never to lose or forget your word sequence string. There is nowhere and no one to turn to if you lose this password key to your wallet. 4. What are my risks and rewards in buying and holding Selendra (SEL)? Selendra (SEL) is a crypto asset that generates, stores and manages value-added through the Selendra Blockchain Network, the interplay of a unique network node base, its community of developers, and a global network of users. As with all crypto assets, Selendra (SEL) is a high-risk / high-stakes investment. You must consider an equal measure that you could lose all of your investment in time or enjoy significant gains. Selendra (SEL) is a broad-based, long-term investment into the global blockchain industry. The Selendra team and a network of developers are a dynamic and growing body of innovative technicians who deploy blockchain applications to create and capture value-added for themselves, their users, and the Selendra network. 5. How do I know Selendra (SEL) is not some sort of scam? Your best defence against any scam is to be well informed and knowledgeable about the investment product under consideration. As an independent investor, you must perform \"due diligence\" toward investigating the investment product you are about to purchase. The Selendra team of developers has been honest and forthright in presenting the technical details, risks and investment potential of the Selendra Blockchain Network. The technical details in our \"White Paper,\" this FAQ, our open online forums, and the personal representations of the founders and developers bring stability and accountability to this investment product. The Selendra team manages an official public channel and discussion group on Telegram to find information archives, support services, and the latest announcements. In addition, you may present questions and make comments in our open public forum. Please join and participate in our community forum here: https://t.me/selendra.org Selendra is an open-source development project with the source code stored and managed on Github . Selendra source code is openly available for public review, and developer contributions are welcomed for consideration. Complete documentation for developers is being continually updated and can be found at https://docs.selendra.org. 6. Who is the Selendra team, and what is their role? Selena's initial inspiration and seed investment spring forth from our sponsoring parent company SmallWorld Venture , a venture builder and seed investment fund based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The Selendra team has been dedicated to research and development within the blockchain industry since 2016. From the beginning, team members held on to a long-term focus, envisioning building a valuable and practical blockchain infrastructure that would effectively serve generations into the future. Cryptocurrency scams today are mainly variants of pooling together a group of unwary investors, pumping up the token price through outlandish claims, then quickly dumping the token for a windfall profit before the inevitable crash in price. Considering establishing a position in the newly emerging global blockchain industry, Selendra early development team members set aside all motivations for short-term gain to focus on long-term organic growth and stability. Our hope is for all developers, investors, holders and users of Selendra to have a long-term outlook toward contributing lasting value to the global blockchain community rather than focusing on the short-term gain at the expense of others. 7.How do I trade Selendra (SEL) for other crypto assets such as BTC or USDT? Initially, Selendra (SEL) can be traded for other crypto assets such as BTC and USDT on PancakeSwap, a decentralized exchange. Toward the end of 2021 and early 2022, Selendra (SEL) will become included for trading on major crypto-asset exchange networks such as Binance.. By mid-2022, Selendra will release its own decentralized trade system within the Selendra's Bitriel Wallet, simplifying the process for devoted Selendra enthusiasts while opening opportunities for Selendra developers. 8. How and where can I spend my Selendra (SEL) crypto assets? Somehow, eventually, merchants and financial institutions will be encouraged to accept Selendra (SEL). No one really knows how or when this will happen. 9. What is staking? As an incentive for network growth, Selendra (SEL) crypto-assets can be acquired through \"staking.\" Staking is a technical term, a process performed by \"stakers\", referring to the distributed process of securing and storage of \"chains\" of digital \"blocks\" on the network. In a technical sense, this distributed \"chain of blocks\" refers to the \"Selendra Blockchain Network.\" The value-added stakers contribute, micro-rewards or small deposits of newly minted Selendra (SEL) crypto assets are paid to the stakers. Anyone can become a staker, and in this way, receive rewards for reducing risk while adding an underlying value to the network. 10. How can I become a staker? A staker must first acquire some amount of Selendra (SEL) assets. Staking the SELs via live.selendra.org (after mainnet launched) and through Bitriel wallet. The best and safest way is to join the norminator pools. 11. How can I become a validator? To become a validator, any node has to stake a minimum of Pi * 10,000 SELs or 31,415 SELs. 12. What is the mainnet? Mainnet is the term used to describe when a blockchain is fully developed and deployed, meaning that its transactions are being broadcasted, verified, and recorded on the network. 13. What is the testnet? Testnet is a development network used for testing future applications and products. Testnet crypto tokens are separate and distinct from actual SEL tokens and are not intended to have any value. 14. When will the mainnet be launched? How do I know when the mainnet has been launched? The Selendra mainnet is scheduled to be deployed during Q4 of 2021. The team announcement will be made via its social channels. 15. How do I make a deposit into the mainnet? Initially, a staker must make a small deposit of SEL crypto-assets into the Selendra Blockchain Network. They can only do this when the mainnet launches. Technical FAQs (Developer) 1. Why do you issue Selendra (SEL) on the Binance Smart Chain? Binance Smart Chain offers lower costs over our next best option of Ethereum. The Binance Exchange has a presence in Cambodia, where we began, and many users worldwide. In addition, Binance is among the most friendly exchanges in Asia. 2. What is the total supply of SEL (tokens?) to be issued? The total supply is limited to and can never exceed 3,141,592,654 SEL, to be released over decades, similar to Bitcoin. The network should cross around half of its supply around year 6. 3. What is the number of Selendra (SEL) token sales? 12% of the total token issued or 376,991,118 SEL is reserved for token sales. 4. How does SEL (BEP-20) differ from a SEL (native) token? The SEL BEP-20 is a token issued on Binance Smart Chain to help kick-start community development through airdrop and token sales. While SEL (native) is a token that will issue on the Selendra mainnet, after the network launches. The holders of SEL (BEP-20) will have to swap for SEL (native) once the mainned network is launched at the ratio of 1:1. 5. Why SEL BEP-20 token? The team would like to raise awareness, build community, and incentivize developers to build apps to run on the Selendra network with our testnet so that our team could gain valuable feedback on what best use of time to improve the network. Thus, we decided to issue SEL on a live network. Thus, we have SEL BEP-20 on Binance Smart Chain. 6. When and how will I receive SEL native tokens? All SEL BEP-20 holders will be notified to swap for SEL native at a ratio of 1:1 when the mainnet launches. 7. How do I swap to SEL native tokens? How do I (swap, trade, or exchange) from (something) to SEL native tokens? You will be instructed when it is time to swap. For Bitriel wallet users, the process will be more automated, while we hope to integrate the swap on other wallets. 8. When do we get the native token? We are planning to have the mainnet launch sometime in Q4 of 2021 or Q1 of 2022. 9. What are the release schedules for SEL tokens? SEL tokens will be released according to the released schedule described earlier in this document. It has long-term, 15 years vesting for teams, 10 years vesting Ecosystem dev fund (foundation to be set up and manage the fund), vesting 6 months to 3 years for investors, and 21 years for mining/staking rewards. 10. What is the circulating supply in the next N years? Many variables can affect the amount of circulating SEL tokens. Staking release schedule, vesting schedule, locked up. The best we can predict is shown in the token sections in the whitepaper. 11. What is the implied valuation of the network? Valuing crypto-assets and their network is complicated, and Selendra will be no exception. The most popular method is by calculating the market cap of the circulating supply (i.e. \"last price paid per token\" x \"total circulating supply\"). This method is obviously flawed in many accounts: it does not capture the underlying value of the network, the volatility and fluctuation of these assets, the significant security risks associated with these networks and assets, nor the value of the technology improvements over time. Please do not use this or any other method to value the Selendra SEL token or any potential investment without fully understanding how a given measure works, what it captures or fails to capture, and how other models work. That said, taking a release schedule into account, and assuming investors choose medium vesting. A scale of SEL token at around 1000 riel or 0.25 USD could mean a market cap between $0 - $200MM in the first one-two years after mainnet launched, with circulating supply between 0 SEL to 820MM SEL. 12. How does vesting work? Token subject to vesting has a usage restriction. They cannot be sold, transferred, spent, or otherwise made use of on the Selendra blockchain. The vesting token will be locked in a smart contract or directly in the blockchain blocks. The rate at which restriction is lifted would depend on the vesting periods predetermined as stated above allocation. Selendra SEL will be added to the liquidity pool for a token swap on PancakeSwap, BitrielSwap, and as well as on exchanges. Hopefully, we will be listed on Binance by the time we launch the mainnet. Out of the 12% of total tokens for investors, there will be up to 3% for private sale to Selendra advisors. 9% will be for public sale via IEO and/or Tokens swap.","title":"FAQs"},{"location":"Faqs/faqs/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"Faqs/faqs/#general-faqs-token-investors","text":"1.

Being a nominator does not require running a node of your own or worrying about online uptime. However, a good nominator performs diligence on the validators that it elects. When looking for validators to nominate, a nominator should pay attention to its own reward percentage for nominating a specific validator - as well as the risk that it bares of being slashed if the validator gets slashed. Setting up Stash and Controller keys Nominators are recommended to set up two separate stash and controller accounts. You can generate your stash and controller account via any of the recommended methods that are detailed on the account generation page. Step 1: Bond your tokens On the UI of Selendra navigate to the \"Staking\" (underneath \"Network\") tab. The \"Account actions\" subsection allows you to stake and nominate. The \"Payouts\" subsection allows you to claim rewards from staking. The \"Targets\" subsection will help you estimate your earnings and this is where it's good to start picking favorites. The \"Waiting\" subsection lists all pending validators that are awaiting more nominations to enter the active validator set. The \"Validator Stats\" subsection allows you to query a validator's stash address and see historical charts on era points, elected stake, rewards, and slashes. Pick \"Account actions\" underneath \"Network\" > \"Staking\", then click the \"+ Nominator\" button. You will see a modal window that looks like the below: Select a \"value bonded\" that is less than the total amount of SEL you have, so you have some left over to pay transaction fees. Transaction fees are currently at least 0.0001 SEL, but they are dynamic based on a variety of factors including the load of recent blocks. Step 2: Nominate a validator You are now bonded. Being bonded means your tokens are locked and could be slashed if the validators you nominate misbehave. All bonded funds can now be distributed to up to 16 validators. Be careful about the validators you choose since you will be slashed if your validator commits an offence. Click on \"Nominate\" on an account you've bonded and you will be presented with another popup asking you to select some validators. Select them, confirm the transaction, and you're done - you are now nominating. Your nominations will become active in the next era.

You will be accountable for not only your own stake, but also the stake of your current nominators. If you make a mistake and get slashed, your money and your reputation will be at risk. However, running a validator can also be very rewarding, knowing that you contribute to the security of a decentralized network while growing your stash. Initial Set-up Requirements Provisioning the server with following recommendation: OS: Linux x64 recommend Ubuntu 18.04 x64. RAM: 2GB or above. HDD/SSD: 60GB. Install Rust curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh rustup update install dependencies sudo apt install make clang pkg-config libssl-dev build-essential Maxos brew install cmake pkg-config openssl git llvm Install & Configure Network Time Protocol (NTP) Client If you are using Ubuntu 18.04 / 19.04, NTP Client should be installed by default. timedatectl If NTP is installed and running, you should see System clock synchronized: yes Do not see it, you can install it by executing: sudo apt-get install ntp ntpd will be started automatically after install. You can query ntpd for status information to verify that everything is working: sudo ntpq -p Building and Installing the indracore Binary git clone https://github.com/selendra/indracore.git cd indracore ./scripts/init.sh cargo build --release You can begin syncing your node by running the following command: ./target/release/indracore --pruning=archive --chain sel if you do not want to start in validator mode right away. The --pruning=archive flag is implied by the --validator and --sentry flags, so it is only required explicitly if you start your node without one of these two options. If you do not set your pruning to archive node, even when not running in validator and sentry mode, you will need to re-sync your database when you switch. Bond SEL Make sure not to bond all your SEL balance since you will be unable to pay transaction fees from your bonded balance. It is now time to set up our validator. We will do the following: Bond the SEL of the Stash account. These SEL will be put at stake for the security of the network and can be slashed. Select the Controller. This is the account that will decide when to start or stop validating. First, go to the Staking section. Click on \"Account Actions\", and then the \"New stake\" button. Once everything is filled in properly, click Bond and sign the transaction with your Stash account. After a few seconds, you should see an \"ExtrinsicSuccess\" message. You should now see a new card with all your accounts (note: you may need to refresh the screen). The bonded amount on the right corresponds to the funds bonded by the Stash account. Set Session Keys Navigate to Toolbox tab and select RPC Calls then select the author > rotateKeys() option and remember to save the output that you get back for a later step. Validate If you go to the \"Staking\" tab, you will see a list of active validators currently running on the network.

With the discovery of blockchain technology, the world is presented with another new revolutionary method for the transmission and exchange of secure data transactions without an intermediary. Blockchain is a newly emerging technology holding the potential to revolutionize the way we interact digitally. With the advent of simple digital networks, the ability to exchange information became quick and easy. With blockchain, in addition to the quick and easy exchange of information, we now have the ability to exchange value. Within the next decade, businesses and governments will continue the steady shift toward peer-to-peer networks and shared economic models. Blockchain represents the next iteration of computing beyond the Internet, offering a combination of six unique features not found in earlier network applications. Information held on the blockchain is decentralized, meaning that data is distributed and securely stored among network users without central control, resulting in no single point of failure, bringing stability and resiliency to the network. Once data is entered on the blockchain, information recorded on the blockchain is immutable, and cannot be changed, modified or altered, making it ideal for creating time-stamped events, registration records related to ownership of assets, such as land, homes, automobiles, financial instruments, voting ballots, identities, or test scores. Transactions recorded on the blockchain are transparent and visible to the public, creating a digital environment of trust, allowing for crypto assets to be held and exchanged as value, and for contracts to be recorded and executed.

With the discovery of blockchain technology, the world is presented with another new revolutionary method for the transmission and exchange of secure data transactions without an intermediary. Blockchain is a newly emerging technology holding the potential to revolutionize the way we interact digitally. With the advent of simple digital networks, the ability to exchange information became quick and easy. With blockchain, in addition to the quick and easy exchange of information, we now have the ability to exchange value. Within the next decade, businesses and governments will continue the steady shift toward peer-to-peer networks and shared economic models. Blockchain represents the next iteration of computing beyond the Internet, offering a combination of six unique features not found in earlier network applications. Information held on the blockchain is decentralized, meaning that data is distributed and securely stored among network users without central control, resulting in no single point of failure, bringing stability and resiliency to the network.

Architecture: General Overview The Selendra Network is built upon the Polkadot Substrate framework, a diversified multi-chain architecture focused on interoperability and ease of development, allowing greater opportunity for early developers to build their own private networks. Selendra architecture provides for a shared, distributed, decentralized, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a peer-to-peer digital network through providing smart contract services which generate transactions on the blockchain network. SeIendra architecture is an extensible, modular, open-source framework with multi-sharding capabilities. Sharding is a database partitioning technique which allows for the deployment of parallel blockchains, or para-chain networks, which are bridged to operate alongside Selendra's main blockchain environment, enabling scalability, faster processing, and reduced network latency. Selendra para-chains allow developers ease and freedom to build their own unique blockchain applications in parallel with the Selendra network, effectively running sub-networks under a Selendra framework. B. Architecture: Forkless Upgrades As with all software, to remain timely, useful and relevant, blockchain software requires upgrades for continued development. Early generation blockchain upgrades required forking, a process requiring weeks, if not months to deploy. Upgrades through the forking process can become controversial, sometimes leading to a hard fork, which in essence splits the development community in two. Selendra employs forkless upgrades enacted through an on-chain governance system, thereby creating enhanced stability through avoiding the forked upgrade process altogether. C. Architecture: Consensus Roles Selendra has four distinct roles for reaching consensus: 1. Validators secure the network through the process of staking, validating proofs from collators, and through participating in consensus with other validators. 1. Collators maintain data shards by collecting shard transactions and producing proofs for validators. They also monitor the network and report abuse to validators. 1. Nominators secure the network by selecting trustworthy validators and stakers. 1. Fishermen monitor the network and report abuse to validators. D. Architecture: Governance Roles Selendra uses a governance mechanism of two distinct committee types that ensure the majority of stakeholders will always secure the network. Holders Council committees are elected to represent passive stakeholders in two primary governance roles, which are proposing referenda, and vetoing dangerous or malicious referenda. Technical committees are composed of active Selendra developers who propose emergency referenda and new features together with the Holders Council for fast-tracked voting and implementation. E. Architecture: Rewards Selendra is a Nominated Proof of Stake blockchain that incentivizes decentralization to maximize chain security through two primary role mechanisms, that of validators and nominators . Validators with greater stakes tend to have more resources for maintaining infrastructure, therefore, validator rewards are paid the same regardless of stake level. Generally, validators with lesser stake levels will pay more to nominators, whereby nominators have an economic incentive to shift toward lower stake validators, resulting in more evenly distributed stakes across validators and avoiding concentrations of power. F. Architecture: Transaction Fees Transaction fees are among the greatest barriers hindering mainstream adoption. Selendra\u2019s approach to this issue is to make transaction fees fixed and very low from the start. Selendra transaction fees are fixed at 0.00001 SEL per transaction. Since the cost per transaction is fixed to the SEL token, the cost per transaction will only vary relative to the SEL token price. For example, assuming 1 SEL token is initially valued at 0.025 USD, the chart below demonstrates transaction fee variations as the price of a Selendra (SEL) token increases in price. $ Price/SEL USD per Transaction # of transaction/USD $0.025 0.00000025 4.000.000 $0.250 0.00000250 400.000 $2.500 0.00002500 40.000 $5.000 0.00005000 20.000 Comparatively within the greater blockchain community, Selendra transaction fees are very low, and will always remain low, even with significant increases in the Selendra (SEL) token price as the above chart illustrates. Long-term low and stable transaction fees allow developers and the community to be more experimental with application development and usage, thereby encouraging innovative development and activity on the network, especially with regard to the deployment of private para-chain applications, bringing greater overall value to the network. Network governance bodies such as validators, norminator, collators and fishermen are rewarded through the staking process, with 30% of transaction fees being paid as rebates, while the remaining 70% are taken out of existence. G. Architecture: Network Abuse Mitigation As Selendra transaction fees are inherently low, the possibility of attack on computing resources is a possibility. To mitigate this issue, prior to performing any transaction, Selendra account holders must maintain a minimum balance of 0.10 SEL (this minimum balance amount will be adjusted accordingly as the network develops). A minimum balance deposit is used to deter network attacks, where the deposit is forfeited upon detection of network abuse. Forfeited deposits are added to the reward pool fund for future payments to validators and other network participants.","title":"Selendra architecture"},{"location":"Whitepaper/selendra-architecture/#selendra-architecture","text":"","title":"Selendra Architecture"},{"location":"Whitepaper/selendra-architecture/#a-architecture-general-overview","text":"The Selendra Network is built upon the Polkadot Substrate framework, a diversified multi-chain architecture focused on interoperability and ease of development, allowing greater opportunity for early developers to build their own private networks.

As per the graph below, during the first year of the initial network launch, approximately 5% of total staking rewards are released. During each of the following years, for the next 20 years, there will be an approximate 5 to 6% decrease in rewards payable from year to year until all rewards are distributed. In the advancing world of blockchain application development, as our reward distribution cycle reaches full maturity, the Selendra reward schedule lays a solid foundation for first generation stakers and developers while continuing to reward the next generation.

Introduction Selendra token investors come in all sizes, both large and small, a globally diverse group of forward thinkers with interests in business, economics, and blockchain network development. To embark on any ambitious project, initial seed capital is often needed, and initial token sales to early-stage investors help provide this necessary start-up capital. Accordingly, we seek a broad range of token investors from a variety of industries, groups and organizations. B. Vesting: Token Sales and Discounts Selendra token sales will take place in four sessions. Each session will help onboard a broader circle of investors and developers into the network. The vesting token sales schedule is as follows: - Aug - Dec 31st 2021 : private-sale & pre-sale up to 3% - Jan 2022 : IDO and DEX Listing Instead of requiring long-term vesting schedules, investors are rewarded with purchase discounts while providing multiple options for different risk profiles. Such vesting purchase discounts create long-term project alignment, and serve as a powerful incentive for early network development. C. Vesting: Strategic Advisors Strategic Advisors are individuals and organizations who have made a strong and significant long-term commitment toward the growth and development of the Selendra network, while receiving the potential for reward. Initial token sales to Strategic Advisor investors are offered with a graduated discount schedule, rewarding early-stage investors who are willing to accept the risks involved toward building the network. Strategic Advisors are offered vesting choices of 1 to 3 years at discounts of 10 to 30 percent, with a minimum vesting schedule of one year and 10,000 USD, or an equivalent amount in other redeemable crypto assets. With a 10,000 USD investment, prior to discount, initial token sales are valued at 0.025 USD/SEL for a token amount of 400,000 SEL. 6 mo vesting : no discount (public sale) 1 yr vesting : 10% discount (minimum presale) 2 yr vesting : 20% discount 3 yr vesting : 30% discount D. Vesting: Selendra development teams Selendra development teams bring a long-term commitment toward building a strong network for mainstream users, next generation developers, token investors, and other network participants. Selendra development teams are rewarded through a linear vesting model over a 15 year period, receiving rewards of 1 percent per year commencing two years after initial network launch. E. Vesting: Selendra Foundation The Selendra Foundation's role is to support developers, educators, community builders from all walks of life to bring value-added to the Selendra network. The foundation has in reserve a 10 percent total reward pool to be distributed at a rate of up to one percent per year over the span of ten years with payouts commencing after the initial launch. F. Vesting: Stakers & Validators Sixty percent of all tokens are held in reserve for the reward pool is gradually distributed to stakers and validators over a span of 20 years. During the first 6 years after launch, 45 percent of this reward pool will be distributed. After 20 years of network development, when the reserve reward pool depletes itself, transaction frequency and amounts will have risen sufficiently to provide adequate revenue generation for validators and stakers through transaction fees and tips alone.","title":"Token sales and vesting schedules"},{"location":"Whitepaper/token-sales-and-vesting-schedules/#token-sales-and-vesting-schedules","text":"A.
