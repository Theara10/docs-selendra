### **Introduction to Selendra**
Selendra is a special purpose multi-chains nominated proof-of-stake network built with the Polkadot Substrate Framework to facilitate micro-economic transactions. It is designed to be interoperable with other open blockchains and developable by developers and students with very minimal learning curve, and ease of use for end-users to interact and benefits from blockchain technology. 

Selendra represents a global network of organizations and individuals whose growth and stability are made possible through the deployment of  value-added applications.

Our mission is to empower young developers throughout the world to quickly and easily learn to create blockchain user-friendly applications for commerce, trade, education, entertainment, storing of data, decentralized computing, assets tokenization and much more.  

Selendra simplifies distributed asset tokenization systems, digital smart contracts, encrypted and decentralized content storage and retrieval, identity, governance and voting systems, internet-of-things and many other network based micro-transactions.

Selendra empowers developers to build blockchain-based business applications with a minimal learning curve, thus expanding mass user-adoption into the global blockchain landscape. 

We aim to enhance the value of the Selendra (SEL) network over the long-term as we attract bright, young and progressive developers, forward-thinking investors, and user participants with combined interests toward achieving a common vision and goals.

As we reach out to all network users of the world, our vision is to always strive toward building the best open blockchain infrastructure, maintaining a focus on contributing health and wealth into the newly emerging global blockchain superstructure.

At the time of writing this paper, Selendra development has reached testnet stage and is being tested with several group decentralized applications (dapp).
