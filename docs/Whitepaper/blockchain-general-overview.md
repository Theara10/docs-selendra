### **Blockchain - A General Overview**

With the invention of paper, the printing press, telegraph, telephone, and digital networks, each opened revolutionary new ways for individuals to communicate and share. With the discovery of blockchain technology, the world is presented with another new revolutionary method for the transmission and exchange of secure data transactions without an intermediary.

Blockchain is a newly emerging technology holding the potential to revolutionize the way we interact digitally. With the advent of simple digital networks, the ability to exchange information became quick and easy. With blockchain, in addition to the quick and easy exchange of information, we now have the ability to exchange value.

Within the next decade, businesses and governments will continue the steady shift toward peer-to-peer networks and shared economic models. Blockchain represents the next iteration of computing beyond the Internet, offering a combination of six unique features not found in earlier network applications.

1. Information held on the blockchain is decentralized, meaning that data is distributed and securely stored among network users without central control, resulting in no single point of failure, bringing stability and resiliency to the network.

1. Once data is entered on the blockchain, information recorded on the blockchain is immutable, and cannot be changed, modified or altered, making it ideal for creating time-stamped events, registration records related to ownership of assets, such as land, homes, automobiles, financial instruments, voting ballots, identities, or test scores.

1. Transactions recorded on the blockchain are transparent and visible to the public, creating a digital environment of trust, allowing for crypto assets to be held and exchanged as value, and for contracts to be recorded and executed.

1. Blockchain provides data integrity, allowing for transactions to be complete, accurate, trustworthy and verifiable at any time. Blockchain algorithms are designed to reach consensus with regard to transactional validity, and completed transactions cannot be altered.

1. Information on the blockchain is cryptographically secure through the consensus process maintaining the security and integrity of shared data.

1. With reduced reliance on centralized computing and data storage, blockchain technology is efficient and saves money, having the potential to lower costs and improve the efficiency of business transactions and record keeping.

As a newly emerging industry, practical blockchain business applications remain limited and inaccessible to most. As with the early adoption of the Internet, full-scale user-friendly applications were years in the making. Blockchain development today is similar to the emergence of the early Internet, with many useful game-changing applications to be deployed in the near future.
